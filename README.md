# Brick Breaker

Previously known as Just Another Breakout Clone is Breakout like game made using BlitzMax NG.


To build this game all you need is game engine called [BlitzMax](https://nitrologic.itch.io/blitzmax) or BlitzMax NG avilable on [GitHub](https://github.com/bmx-ng/bmx-ng/releases) and on [BlitzMax.org](https://blitzmax.org).

I recommend using BlitzMax NG because that is the engine I used to make this game
